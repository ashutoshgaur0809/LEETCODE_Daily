# Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
# Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
# It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
# Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
# It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
